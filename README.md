# DRL-Banana-Unity


## Project Details

This is the second project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree. In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

These are the details of this Unity environment:

```
Unity Academy name: Academy
        Number of Brains: 1
        Number of External Brains : 1
        Lesson number : 0
        Reset Parameters :
		goal_speed -> 1.0
		goal_size -> 5.0
Unity brain name: ReacherBrain
        Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
        Vector Observation space type: continuous
        Vector Observation space size (per agent): 33
        Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
        Vector Action space type: continuous
        Vector Action space size (per agent): 4
        Vector Action descriptions: , , , 
```

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

## Getting Started

This repository presents solves the problen for a version containing 20 agents. You will need to download the Unity environment from one of these links depending on your operating system:

- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

The code is written in Python. Make sure you have a  `python 3.6` environment with the following dependencies: `PyTorch` and `ml-agents`

## Instructions

Run the notebook `Solution.ipynb` to train the agents. For this version containing 20 agents, the environment is considered solved when the average score reaches +30, over 100 consecutive episodes and over all 20 agents.
